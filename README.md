# Pytris

A simple Tetris-like game for Python. Requires pygame and a Python interpreter version 3.10 or higher.
This implementation hasn't really been optimized, but for such a simple game, it should be fast enough.

It has been written as an exercise while looking into Python.

Run Pytris.py to start it
